# ultimate_timer
You can save your timer presets, such as Pomodoro timer, Tabata traning timer.
Customize interval and duration as you wish.

I hate the moment when I have to set timer XX:30 because I have to swipe ultil it is exactly "thirty" seconds.

With this app, me and you no longer have to get frustrated by those moments.
